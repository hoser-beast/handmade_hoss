Handmade Hoss
=============

Casey Muratory has been influential in the way that he approaches programming.
His emphasis on minimalism (i.e., doing most things from scratch) and making
very high quality software is appealing to me. As an example, his use of a
simple batch file to compile his projects is refreshing in a world filled with
overly-complicated build systems made with layers stacked on top of layers.

The purpose of this project is to follow along with Casey's Handmade Hero
series and study his way of programming games in Windows.

While not much of a gamer, I am in awe of the skill that is specifically
required to make video games because of their complexity and the need for high
performance.

I would like to complete at least the first one hundred days to get an idea of
how one would go about creating a custom library that is lean and fast for use
in graphics applications.
